      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Proses is a project I began working on independently in late August with
        the hopes of making creative writing a visual experience. It is in the
        early stages, and I am proud of the work I've done so far. Out of all
        the projects I've made, I think this project has the most potential, and
        I am happy to see where it goes.
      </p>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        At best, writing tools help users organize their chapters and scenes.
        They don't help users visualize their stories or enhance productivity
        and creativty. They expect users to organize their characters and plot
        threads into plain text files or flashcards.
      </p>

      <p>
        But what if there was a tool to help writers visually engage with their
        stories from rough outline to final draft?
      </p>
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        Proses will help writers keep track of their outlines and progress by
        visualizing these two core elements:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>Plot Thread Beats</li>
        <li>Character Relations</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It will also equip writers with different tools for editing and
        productivity.
      </p>

      <p><b>Analysis Mode</b> - Highlights adverbs, cliches, and tells.</p>
      <p><b>Senses Mode</b> - Highlights senses.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Flow View</b> - Turns the screen black and disables the use of
        backspace in hopes the writer can enter the <i>Flow State</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Rhythm View</b> - Turns every sentence into a vertical column on a
        bar graph. Helps writers see the <i>waves</i> of their writing and how
        varied their sentences are.
      </p>
      <p><b>Potential Additional Features:</b></p>
      <p>
        I have gained access to OpenAI's beta program. Before a public launch,
        OpenAI must grant approval. Because of this, it can't be guarenteed
        whether or not these features will make it. Ideally, with the help of
        OpenAI, Proses will allow users to do the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>Simulate conversations with their characters.</li>
        <li>Simulate scenes in their story.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There is also a social media aspect I have been thinking about. The
        first page means everything in a story, and I think the idea of users
        receiving feedback on this initial impression can be beneficial. Users
        can be rated on the quality and helpfulness of their feedback. Based on
        that quality, they can get more points to submit their writing to more
        people, which encourages thoughtful answers. This is an idea I'm only
        playing around with at the moment, and would have to see how it fits in
        with the core identity of Proses once I finish the initial designs.
