      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Proses is a project I began working on independently in late August with
        the hopes of making creative writing a visual experience. I want writers
        to be able to engage with their stories on a deeper level than what
        other tools allow. The creative writing process hasn't ever evolved into
        something that is very... well... creative. I want to change that.
      </p>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        At best, writing tools help users organize their chapters and scenes.
        They don't help users visualize their stories or enhance productivity
        and creativity. They expect users to organize their characters and plot
        threads into plain text files or flashcards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proses helps writers simply write. It minimizes distractions, uses
        common study method techniques to help writers write in sprints, and
        gives writers the ability to turn off their screen completely and only
        regain the ability to see what they produced (as well as the ability to
        edit their work) once thier goal is complete. For first drafts, this is
        everything.
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        Proses will help writers keep track of their outlines and progress by
        visualizing these two core elements:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>Visual editing</li>
        <li>Visual outlines (character & plot)</li>
        <li>Better story navigation</li>
        <li>Productivity Tools</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Proses will equip writers with editing and productivity tools.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sprint Timers</b> - Set a word count goal and write in short bursts.
        Reach your goal, take a break, then get back to it!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Flow View</b> - Turns the screen black and disables the use of
        backspace in hopes the writer can enter the <i>Flow State</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As well as tools to help visualize their stories, whether it be through
        outlines or through prose.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>Plot Thread Beats</li>
        <li>Character Relations</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Analysis Mode</b> - Highlights adverbs, cliches, and tells.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rhythm View</b> - Turns every sentence into a vertical column on a
        bar graph. Helps writers see the <i>waves</i> of their writing and how
        varied their sentences are.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also gained access to OpenAI's beta program. Before a public
        launch, OpenAI must grant approval. Because of this, it can't be
        guaranteed whether or not these features will make it. Ideally, with the
        help of OpenAI, Proses will allow users to do the following:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Simulate conversations with their characters</b> - Feed dialogue of
        any character and have a conversation with them. The AI will pick up on
        their voice and inspire dialogue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Simulate scenes in their story.</b> - Feed previous scenes to the AI
        and take turns writing the story. The AI may not create the greatest
        works, but it will certainly help explore potential exciting new ideas!
