      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>
        Automation bots allow users to enter a link to a product that's
        out-of-stock and automatically purchase it once it is in stock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Millie was a capstone project I worked on with 2 other students. I
        worked mainly on the application's front-end and advocated heavily for
        the user, constantly asking questions on how we could make a bot
        accessible for users not accustomed to the complexity of similar tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        My main goal was to <b>help the average user</b> get the items they
        need.
      </p>

      <h3>Objective</h3>

      <p>
        The average consumer struggled getting the items they needed during the
        pandemic. Available bots were complex. They required the user to know
        what a proxy was and set manual delays on things. The likelihood of the
        average person knowing what these things even were was low. We wanted to
        empower this type of user, the average consumer.
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>

      <p>
        During an <b>analysis of our competitors</b>, I discovered the strengths
        and weaknesses of many different automation bots. A commonality in
        weaknesses was their complexity. My focus throughout the project which I
        regularly emphasized to the team was to create an interface less complex
        than other bots, by giving new users simple instructions and default
        settings while still allowing power users maintain their expected level
        of control. We wanted to capitalize on targeting average users. With
        this goal in mind, I created a simple interface that still allowed power
        users to customize their approach.
      </p>

      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project was one of my first experiences working with a team of
        other developers on a single project. Given the nature of the project,
        we didn't get to test the software on users, though we did receive
        positive feedback from our peers (a few even asked for copies of the
        software). Throughout this process, I found how incredible the
        development process was when working with a talented team.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Diverse Teams Amplify </b>— It's easy to get absorbed in your own
        world when you're the only one working on a project. Having other
        perspectives can help you rethink things you may have overlooked. Having
        a well-rounded team with different backgrounds can only result in a more
        well-rounded product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Communication is Key </b>— Given that this project took place during
        lockdown, and we were all working remotely on this project,
        communication was critical. Because of our team's communication, we were
        able to produce a complete piece of software that fulfilled all our
        initial requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Agile Works</b>— We used an Agile approach to our development
        process. Our team met regularly and communicated what we were working
        on, had finished, and were having trouble on. This really helped us
        address any potential problems keeping us from delivering on
        requirements. Additionally, we met with our stakeholder throughout the
        semester which also helped shape the course of our development.
