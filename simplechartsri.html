      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        SimpleChartsRI is a data visualization web-tool I was given the task of
        creating while working on a grant under the
        <b>National Science Foundation</b> at Rhode Island College, initially as
        a Research Technician.
      </p>

      <p>I shaped the site's direction through the following methods:</p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>Surveys</li>
        <li>Observations</li>
        <li>Literature Review</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I presented the web-tool (our research project) at the following events:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>CCSCNE 2021 Conference</li>
        <li>2021 RI NSF EPSCoR Symposium</li>
        <li>Data Visualization: The Great Synthesizer workshop</li>
        <li>Inner team during weekly meetings</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I also attended the Developing Soundbites Workshop W/ Metcalf Institute
        workshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Overall</b>, I had a lot of freedom working on this project and
        worked on the site up until around May 2021, after my contract ended and
        a new line of work began under my proposal. I learned a tremendous
        amount and through this project I developed a passion for focusing on
        the <b>user's experience</b>.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>

      <p>
        Current data visualization tools didn't offer much when helping specific
        users, especially teachers. They were aimed towards a
        <b>general audience</b>. Teachers, who were already under a constant
        time crunch, couldn't gain much from these tools. They still had to find
        good data themselves, which is the most <b>timely</b> part of making an
        engaging chart. These tools also didn't guide users towards best
        practices, which could result in <b>ineffective</b> visualizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        During a data visualization workshop, I helped a group of teachers
        create a visualization that they would incorporate with a lesson plan.
        While working with them, I noticed how the teachers <b>struggled</b> to
        find datasets that would be simple and engaging for their high-school
        students. They asked questions like, "Would this be interesting to our
        students," "Is this data too complex," "Will our students have trouble
        cleaning this data," and "Will our students understand the ideas behind
        this data?" As soon as I heard those questions, I realized our site had
        to help <b>fix</b> this problem.
      </p>

      <h3>Research</h3>

      <p>
        The initial foundation of the site was influenced through surveys
        gathered from around 20 high-school teachers. This helped inform us on
        what options they were expecting in a data visualization tool and what
        would help them most. The aforementioned observations additionally
        helped with this foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To influence the design and help form the idea further, I
        <b>extensively researched and reviewed literature</b>. I searched any
        and all information that helped charts engage their audience. I found a
        number of factors that played into how effective a visualization was.
        The main takeaway I found was centered around the idea of
        <b>proximity</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This helped me guide the direction of SimpleChartsRI towards maintaining
        a collection of datasets that would be relevant to a Rhode Island
        high-school audience. This is what set apart our website from others. It
        aimed to have ready-to-go datasets that teachers could instantly use,
        without any need for searching or cleaning it themselves. Because of the
        idea of proximity, the datasets would have a higher chance at
        <b>engaging students</b>.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project gave me a passion for UX/UI design. It gave me an
        opportunity to work on a project and think about all of its parts — both
        the whole picture and every last miniscule detail. It helped me realize
        the empathy I have for the user's experience. While it was a lot of work
        acting as the UX/UI Designer, Frontend Engineer, and Backend Engineer,
        it taught me an incredible amount, and I thrived off the challenge. I
        found that I deeply enjoy thinking about how the user will interact with
        the interface and simplifying that experience into something pleasant. I
        learned many lessons, but three stuck out the most.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Teamwork is Everything </b>— It's easy to get absorbed in your own
        world when you're the only one working on a project. Having other
        perspectives can help you rethink things you may have overlooked. Having
        a well-rounded team with different backgrounds can only result in a more
        well-rounded product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Testing is Also... Everything </b>— Things go wrong. It's a natural
        part of the process. Thinking about potential problems before they
        happen can save future headaches. There can be backend problems with how
        data is gathered, problems with how that data is sent to the frontend,
        problems with the frontend... The list goes on and on. I learned how
        regularly problems, even the same problems, can appear and reappear with
        every change to the codebase. I walked away having a better appreciation
        not only for testing, but for the design phase in general. Spending more
        time on that phase can be crucial and save both time and money.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Passion is Crucial</b>— Without it, I don't think I would have
        accomplished half of what I did on this project. Learning new
        technologies and focusing on a problem that I felt was crucial helped
        constantly motivate me. I went from knowing very little HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, to feeling comfortable implementing any and every feature.
