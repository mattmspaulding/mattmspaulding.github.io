      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        SimpleChartsRI is a website I was given the task of creating while
        working on a grant under the <b>National Science Foundation</b>. I was
        hired as an intern for 10 weeks in the Summer of 2020. I was rehired at
        the end of the Summer, then hired again for a third time on a contract
        basis after my graduation in December. I had a lot of freedom working on
        this project and <b>created all aspects</b> of the site up until April
        2021, when my contract ended and a new line of work began under my
        proposol.
      </p>

      <p>
        When beginning my work on the site, my only limitations were that the
        site needed to address non tech-savvy high-school teachers and help them
        make charts. I hit the ground running and
        <b>produced mockups and designs.</b>
        Within three weeks, I had a functioning version of the website that I
        demoed to a group of high-school teachers during a workshop.
      </p>

      <p>
        During that workshop, while working with teachers to create
        visualizations for classroom use and noticing the <b>struggle</b> to
        find datasets that would be simple and engaging for high-school
        students, I found the <b>core identity</b> of what would soon become
        SimpleChartsRI.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>

      <p>
        Current tools didn't offer much when helping specific users. They were
        aimed towards a <b>general audience</b>. Teachers, who were already
        under constant time crunch, couldn't gain much of a benefit from chart
        making tools. These tools still required users to find the data
        themselves, which is the most timely part of making an engaging chart.
      </p>

      <h3>Approach</h3>

      <p>
        The site's ultimate focus is to help users create engaging charts
        quickly. This means users must be able to find engaging datasets through
        the website, and use those datasets to create a chart through the
        website. Because the project is aimed towards teachers who perhaps
        aren't tech-savvy, additional help should be given to notify them of
        potential mistakes that may make a chart ineffective.
      </p>
      <p>
        My focus during my time on the project was to create a foundation for
        the site. So that's what I did. I created a way for users to upload
        their data and have that data get parsed into a format the charts (which
        I created using Chart.js) could understand. After completing that, it
        was mostly about customization options, handling errors, and creating a
        consistent format throughout every step of the user's chart-making
        process. The customization options I made were as follows:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>1) Change Chart Type</b> - dynamically create an overlapping chart by
        specifying each dataset's chart type, or change the whole thing at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2) Change Color Scheme</b> - look at a preview of each color scheme
        and customize it to your liking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3) Customize Labels </b> - chart's title, x-axis label, and y-axis
        label.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4) Change Data</b> - dynamically open up a spreadsheet that shows you
        all of the chart's data and lets you edit it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also created features for downloading your chart, resetting all the
        chart's properties, zooming & panning on the chart, resetting the zoom,
        hiding the legend (for data files with many datasets), and chart type
        specific features like turning vertical bars into horizontal bars. As
        well
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project gave me a passion for UX/UI design. It gave me an
        opportunity to work on a project and think about all of its parts — both
        the whole picture and every last miniscule detail. While it was a lot of
        work acting as the UX/UI Designer, Frontend Engineer, and Backend
        Engineer, it taught me an incredible amount. I found that I deeply enjoy
        thinking about how the user will interact with the interface and
        simplifying that experience into something pleasant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Teamwork is Everything </b>— It's easy to get absorbed in your own
        world when you're the only one working on a project. Having other
        perspectives can help you rethink things you may have overlooked. Having
        a well-rounded team with different backgrounds can only result in a more
        well-rounded product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Testing is Also... Everything </b>— Things go wrong. It's a natural
        part of the process. Thinking about potential problems before they
        happen can save future headaches. There can be backend problems with how
        data is gathered, problems with how that data is sent to the frontend,
        problems with the frontend... The list goes on and on. I learned how
        reguarly problems, even the same problems, can appear and reappear with
        every change to the codebase.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Passion is Crucial</b>— Without it, I don't think I wouldn't have
        accomplished half of what I did on this project. Learning new
        technologies and focusing on a problem that I felt was crucial helped
        constantly motivate me. I went from knowing very little HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, to feeling comfortable implementing any and every feature.
