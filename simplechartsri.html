      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        SimpleChartsRI is a data visualization web-tool I was given the task of
        creating while working as a Research Technician on a grant under the
        <b>National Science Foundation</b> at Rhode Island College.
      </p>

      <p>
        I shaped the site's direction through the following research methods:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>Surveys</li>
        <li>Observations</li>
        <li>Literature Review</li>
        <li>Competitor Analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I presented the web-tool (our research project) at the following events:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>CCSCNE 2021 Conference</li>
        <li>2021 RI NSF EPSCoR Symposium</li>
        <li>Data Visualization: The Great Synthesizer workshop</li>
        <li>Weekly Team Meetings</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I also attended the Developing Soundbites Workshop W/ Metcalf Institute
        workshop.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Overall</b>, I had a lot of freedom working on this project and
        worked on the site up until around May 2021, after my contract ended and
        a new line of work began under my proposal. I learned a tremendous
        amount and through this project I developed a passion for focusing on
        the <b>user's experience</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On October 11th 2021, our <b>Research Article</b> discussing our tool's
        impact on the field was <b>Accepted</b> by Frontiers Journal!
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>

      <p>
        Current data visualization tools didn't offer much when helping specific
        users, especially teachers. They were aimed towards a
        <b>general audience</b>. Teachers, who were already under a constant
        time crunch, couldn't gain much from these tools. They still had to find
        good data themselves, which is the most <b>timely</b> part of making an
        engaging chart. These tools also didn't guide users towards best
        practices, which could result in <b>ineffective</b> visualizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        During a data visualization workshop, I helped a group of teachers
        create a visualization that they would incorporate with a lesson plan.
        While working with them, I noticed how the <b>teachers struggled</b> to
        find datasets that would be simple and engaging for their high-school
        students. They asked questions like, "Would this be interesting to our
        students," "Is this data too complex," "Will our students have trouble
        cleaning this data," and "Will our students understand the ideas behind
        this data?" As soon as I heard those questions, I realized our site had
        to help <b>fix</b> this problem.
      </p>

      <h3>Research</h3>

      <p>
        The initial foundation of the site was influenced through surveys
        gathered from around 20 high-school teachers. To influence the design
        and help form the idea further, I
        <b>extensively researched and reviewed literature</b>. I found a number
        of factors that determined an effective visualization. The main takeaway
        I found was centered around the idea of <b>proximity</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This helped guide the direction of SimpleChartsRI towards maintaining a
        collection of datasets that would be relevant to a Rhode Island
        high-school audience. This set apart our website from others. Our tool
        aimed to have ready-to-go datasets that teachers could instantly use,
        without any need for searching or cleaning it themselves. Because of the
        idea of proximity, the datasets would have a higher chance at
        <b>engaging students</b>.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project gave me a passion for UX/UI work, research, and working
        together with users to solve problems. It helped me realize the empathy
        I have for the user's experience. I learned many lessons throughout this
        time, but three stuck out the most.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Teamwork is Everything </b>— It's easy to get absorbed in your own
        world when you're the only one working on a project. Having other
        perspectives can help you rethink things you may have overlooked. Having
        a well-rounded team with different backgrounds can only result in a more
        well-rounded product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Testing is Also... Everything </b>— Things go wrong. It's a natural
        part of the process. I learned how regularly problems, even the same
        problems, can appear and reappear with every change to the codebase. I
        walked away having a better appreciation not only for testing, but for
        the design phase in general. Spending more time on that phase can be
        crucial and save both time and money.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Passion is Crucial</b>— Without it, I don't think I would have
        accomplished half of what I did on this project. Learning new
        technologies and focusing on a problem that I felt was crucial helped
        constantly motivate me. I went from knowing very little HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, to feeling comfortable implementing any feature.
