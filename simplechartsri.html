      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        SimpleChartsRI is a data visualization web-tool I was given the task of
        creating while working as a Research Technician on a grant under the
        <b>National Science Foundation</b> at Rhode Island College.
      </p>

      <p>
        I shaped the site's direction through the following research methods:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>Surveys</li>
        <li>Observations</li>
        <li>Literature Review</li>
        <li>Competitor Analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Overall, I had a lot of freedom working on this project and worked on
        the site up until around May 2021, after my contract ended and a new
        line of work began under my proposal. I learned a tremendous amount and
        through this project I developed a passion for focusing on the
        <b>user's experience</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In October 2021, our Research Article discussing our tool's impact on
        the field was published by Frontiers Journal!

      <h3>Objective</h3>

      <p>
        During a data visualization workshop, I helped a group of teachers
        create a visualization that they would incorporate with a lesson plan.
        While working with them, I noticed how the <b>teachers struggled</b> to
        find datasets that would be simple and engaging for their high-school
        students. They asked questions like, "Would this be interesting to our
        students," "Is this data too complex," "Will our students have trouble
        cleaning this data," and "Will our students understand the ideas behind
        this data?" As soon as I heard these questions, I realized our site had
        to help <b>solve</b> this problem.
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>

      <p>
        The initial foundation of the site was influenced through surveys
        gathered from around 20 high-school teachers. Given that the education
        field already contains an extensive amount of research, I
        <b>researched and reviewed literature</b> and found a number of factors
        that led to effective visualizations. The main takeaway I found was
        centered around the idea of proximity.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also spent some time <b>analyzing similar web-tools</b>. I found that
        data visualization tools don't offer much when helping specific users,
        especially teachers. They're aimed towards a general audience. Teachers
        (who are already under a constant time crunch) still have to find good
        data themselves, which is the most timely part of making an engaging
        chart. These tools don't guide users towards best practices either,
        which can lead to ineffective visualizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        These insights helped guide the direction of SimpleChartsRI towards
        maintaining a collection of datasets that would be relevant to a Rhode
        Island high-school audience. This set apart our website from others. Our
        tool aimed to have ready-to-go datasets that teachers could instantly
        use, without any need for searching or cleaning it themselves. Because
        of the idea of proximity, the datasets would have a higher chance at
        <b>engaging students</b>.
      </p>

      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project gave me a passion for UX/UI work, research, and working
        together with users to solve problems. It helped me realize the empathy
        I have for the user's experience. I learned many lessons throughout this
        time, but five stuck out the most.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Compensation is Crucial</b>— Survey responses towards the end were
        low. When we weren't able to leverage our workshop to get survey
        responses, the surveys fell flat. At the time of the project, we were
        working through a pandemic. As shown through research, teachers were
        already strained on time. During a pandemic, this was even clearer.
        Asking teachers to essentially do volunteer work was a lot to ask. If I
        could do this again, I would have opted to leverage a portion of our
        budget towards compensating any of our target users who wanted to give
        us some feedback. After all, even beloved companies like Google pay
        their users for responses. This would have given us the feedback we
        needed to fix any problems in the site earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Design Early and Receive Feedback Often</b>— When I began the
        project, I had 3 weeks to work on the web-tool until I was expected to
        demo it during a workshop to our target users. For those 3 weeks I
        passionately worked on the project and build out a functional version of
        the site, which I thought would be more exciting for teachers to engage
        with. While I admire my drive, I think I should have spent more time on
        mockups and receiving feedback earlier rather than later. I didn't rely
        on design (utilizing programs like Figma) heavily enough, and often
        found myself tweaking CSS code and refreshing the page a dozen times to
        get something right. If I had spent time designing each page in Figma
        first, I could have received feedback on those designs (which are easier
        to tweak) and saved myself time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Teamwork is Everything </b>— It's easy to get absorbed in your own
        world when you're the only one working on a project. Having other
        perspectives can help you rethink things you may have overlooked. Having
        a well-rounded team with different backgrounds can only result in a more
        well-rounded product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Testing is Also... Everything </b>— Things go wrong. It's a natural
        part of the process. I learned how regularly problems, even the same
        problems, can appear and reappear with every change. I walked away from
        this project having a better appreciation but for the design phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Passion, Passion, Passion</b>— Without it, I don't think I would have
        accomplished half of what I did on this project. Learning new
        technologies and focusing on a problem that I felt was important helped
        constantly motivate me. I went from knowing very little HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, to feeling comfortable implementing any feature.
