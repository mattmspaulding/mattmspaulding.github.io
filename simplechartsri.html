      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Student engagement is crucial to memory retention. Visualizations can
        help engage students. However, it is timely. Finding, formatting, and
        displaying data can become a headache for a teacher who is already short
        on time. Lastly, current visualization tools can be confusing for
        non-tech-savvy teachers.
      </p>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
        SimpleChartsRI is a free and easy-to-use web-tool that provides engaging
        datasets and relevant information for creating effective charts.
        Teachers rated the tool favorably (4.36/5.0) in terms of usability and
        identified it as a tool to complement their lessons.
      </p>

      <h3>My Impact</h3>
      <p>
        While working as a Research Technician on a National Science Foundation
        grant at Rhode Island College, I was given the task of creating a data
        visualization web-tool. I created an identity for the tool through
        market research, user surveys, and workshop observations. After that I
        built a list of requirements, created some mockups, and developed
        version 1.0.
      </p>

      <h3>My Process</h3>

      <p>
        When given the task of creating a data visualization tool, we didn't
        know what that would look like. After asking clarifying questions,
        analyzing surveys and competitors, I identified our tool's requirements
        and established how our tool could help.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within 3 weeks I created a working prototype of our tool and demoed it
        to teachers during a data visualization workshop. I assumed the teachers
        would have the most difficulties with creating a visualization, but I
        was wrong. Which was exciting!
      </p>
      <p>
        The teachers struggled with finding simple and engaging datasets. They
        asked the following questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Would this be interesting to our students?"</li>
        <li>"Is this data too complex?"</li>
        <li>"Will our students have trouble cleaning this data?"</li>
        <li>"Will our students understand the ideas behind this data?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As soon as I heard these questions, I realized our site had to help
        solve this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I researched what made effective visualizations and created an identity
        for our site. Our site would save teachers time by providing many
        relevant datasets that are engaging because of their proximity (how
        close the data in the datasets are via location or time) to students.
      </p>

      <p>
        When designing the tool, I also followed a usability paper that gave
        optimal specifications, such as the best font size or button size, for
        elderly users, which complemented an initial design decision to create
        the web-tool for non-tech-savvy teachers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the project, I received feedback and made adjustments as
        needed. I adapted and took criticism well. Overall, my goal was to
        create a tool that best served our users.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How to dig deeper into a problem, gain clarification, and employ the
          correct solution.
        </li>

        <li>
          Effective communication comes from precise and well thought out
          points.
        </li>

        <li>
          Empathizing with the user will always help you identify gaps in
          whatever you are working on.
        </li>

        <li>
          Pressure helps me focus. Without knowing much about web development, I
          built a functional website within 3 weeks (under a deadline) while
          also handling many other tasks.
        </li>

        <li>
          Teams are only healthy with constant feedback. Having others give
          feedback keeps your perspective fresh.
        </li>
        <li>
          I enjoy communicating my work. I presented as a speaker, but also
          created posters, videos, and soundbites. I found myself editing videos
          down to every frame and using audio plugins to ensure my voice sounded
          as pleasant as possible, devoid of any crackles or background noise,
          so the audience could clearly understand my research.
        </li>
      </ul>

          rather than having to search something themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          The teachers found they could implement the tool into student
          assignments and increase their students' data analysis skills.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>

        To recap, I envisioned the site having a larger selection of engaging
        data as well more ways to streamline the data cleaning process. In
        addition, I wanted the web-tool to guide teachers towards best
        practices. I wrote a proposal to extend the work on this tool, and that
        proposal was accepted. After another student's work, the datasets
        available on the site have increased massively.
