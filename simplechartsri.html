      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        SimpleChartsRI is a website I was given the task of creating while
        working on a grant under the <b>National Science Foundation</b>. Through
        <b>surveys and key observations</b> I made during discussions with
        potential users, I shaped the direction of the site. I had a lot of
        freedom working on this project and worked on the site up until April
        2021, when my contract ended and a new line of work began under my
        proposol. I learned a tremendous amount, and through this project I
        developed a passion for focusing on the <b>user's experience</b>.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>

      <p>
        Current tools didn't offer much when helping specific users, especially
        teachers. They were aimed towards a <b>general audience</b>. Teachers,
        who were already under constant time crunch, couldn't gain much from
        chart making tools. These tools still required users to find the data
        themselves, which is the most <b>timely</b> part of making an engaging
        chart. These tools also didn't guide users towards best practices, which
        could result in <b>ineffective</b> visualizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        During a data visualization workshop, I helped a group of teachers
        create a visualization that they would incorporate with a lesson plan.
        While working with them, I noticed how the teachers <b>struggled</b> to
        find datasets that would be simple and engaging for their high-school
        students. They asked questions like, "Would this be interesting to our
        students," "Is this data too complex," "Will our students have trouble
        cleaning this data," and "Will our students understand the ideas behind
        this data?" As soon as I heard those questions, I realized our site had
        to help <b>fix</b> this problem.
      </p>

      <h3>Research</h3>

      <p>
        The initial foundation of the site was influenced through surveys
        gathered from around 20 high-school teachers. This helped inform us on
        what options they were expecting in a data visualization tool and what
        would help them most.
      </p>
      <p>
        To influence the design and help form the idea further, I
        <b>extensively researched and reviewed literature</b>. Again, the point
        of the site is to engage students. With this in mind, I searched any and
        all information that helped charts engage their audience. I found a
        number of factors that played into how powerful a visualization was. The
        main takeaway I found was centered around the idea of <b>proximity</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This helped me guide the direction of SimpleChartsRI towards maintaining
        a collection of datasets that would be relavant to a Rhode Island
        high-school audience. This is what set apart our website from others. It
        aimed to have ready-to-go datasets that teachers could instantly use,
        without any need for searching or cleaning it themselves. Because of the
        idea of proximity, the datasets would have a higher chance at
        <b>engaging students</b>.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project gave me a passion for UX/UI design. It gave me an
        opportunity to work on a project and think about all of its parts — both
        the whole picture and every last miniscule detail. While it was a lot of
        work acting as the UX/UI Designer, Frontend Engineer, and Backend
        Engineer, it taught me an incredible amount. I found that I deeply enjoy
        thinking about how the user will interact with the interface and
        simplifying that experience into something pleasant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Teamwork is Everything </b>— It's easy to get absorbed in your own
        world when you're the only one working on a project. Having other
        perspectives can help you rethink things you may have overlooked. Having
        a well-rounded team with different backgrounds can only result in a more
        well-rounded product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Testing is Also... Everything </b>— Things go wrong. It's a natural
        part of the process. Thinking about potential problems before they
        happen can save future headaches. There can be backend problems with how
        data is gathered, problems with how that data is sent to the frontend,
        problems with the frontend... The list goes on and on. I learned how
        reguarly problems, even the same problems, can appear and reappear with
        every change to the codebase.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Passion is Crucial</b>— Without it, I don't think I wouldn't have
        accomplished half of what I did on this project. Learning new
        technologies and focusing on a problem that I felt was crucial helped
        constantly motivate me. I went from knowing very little HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, to feeling comfortable implementing any and every feature.
