      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        While working as a Research Technician on a National Science Foundation
        grant at Rhode Island College, I was given the task of creating a data
        visualization web-tool. I created an identity for the tool through
        market research, user surveys, and workshop observations. After that I
        built a list of requirements, created some mockups, and got to
        programming!
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, I had a lot of freedom working on this project and worked on
        the site up until around May 2021, after my contract ended and a new
        line of work began under my proposal. I learned a tremendous amount and
        through this project I developed a passion for focusing on the
        <b>user's experience</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In October 2021, our research article discussing our tool was published
        by Frontiers Journal!

      <h3>A Simple Look at What I Didn't Know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How to conduct research—truthfully, I didn't even know UX Research as
          a field existed.
        </li>

        <li>How to translate UXR findings into actionable tasks.</li>
        <li>
          How to communicate research findings differently depending on my
          audience.
        </li>
        <li>
          A slew of other things; data visualization, web development, survey
          writing, the list goes on and on...
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>A Simple Look at What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I know how to dig deeper into a problem, gain clarification, and
          ultimately employ a research method.
        </li>

        <li>
          When approaching any particular research method, I know the outcome
          I'm aiming for, which means that even if I'm not familiar with a
          specific method I can quickly learn it, understand it, and come to a
          meaningful conclusion.
        </li>

        <li>
          I had an easy time translating research insights into actionable
          recommendations.
        </li>

        <li>
          I truly have a passion for learning. Without knowing anything about
          web development, I built a functional website within 3 weeks. At the
          same time, I quickly picked up new research methods and employed them
          regularly. I became familiar with surveys, competitive analysis, and
          market research all in a short span.
        </li>

        <li>
          Early in my undergrad I had difficulties taking criticism. Now I
          expect feedback and wouldn't consider myself a part of a healthy team
          unless that feedback existed.
        </li>

        <li>
          I loved changing how I presented my findings depending on the
          audience. I presented as a speaker, but also created posters, videos,
          and soundbites. I found myself editing videos down to every frame and
          using audio plugins to ensure my voice sounded as pleasant as
          possible, devoid of any crackles or background noise, so the audience
          could clearly understand my research.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Process</h3>

      <p>
        When I was initially introduced to the project I was told to create a
        data visualization tool. At first this concept was just an idea, but
        after asking <b>clarifying questions</b> I was able to identify
        requirements and outcome expectations.
      </p>

      <p>
        After understanding stakeholder expectations, I began research to gauge
        interest in our tool. After analyzing surveys from around 20 high-school
        teachers, I found what features teachers wanted out of a data
        visualization tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, I <b>reviewed literature and analyzed competing tools</b> to see
        what was working and what needed improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within 3 weeks I created a working prototype of our tool and demoed it
        to teachers during a data visualization workshop. I was able to sit in
        with a group of teachers as they went about creating a lesson plan
        around data visualization. I assumed they would have the most
        difficulties with the visualization itself,
        <b>but was wrong. Which was exciting!</b> The teachers struggled instead
        with finding datasets that would be simple and engaging for their
        students. They asked questions like, "Would this be interesting to our
        students," "Is this data too complex," "Will our students have trouble
        cleaning this data," and "Will our students understand the ideas behind
        this data?" As soon as I heard these questions, I realized our site had
        to <b>help solve</b> this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through all of this research, I found an identity for our tool. It would
        save teachers time by providing many relevant datasets that are engaging
        because of their proximity (how close the data in the datasets are via
        location or time) to students.
      </p>

      <p>
        When designing the tool, I followed a usability paper that gave optimal
        specifications, such as the best font size or button size, for elderly
        users. This design decision was meant to help all teachers, no matter
        their background in tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the project, I received feedback and made adjustments as
        needed. I adapted and took criticism well, and my goal and core focus
        was to create a tool that best served our users.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <p>
        Insights from our
        <a
          href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2021.706939/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Computer_Science&id=706939"
          >Frontiers in Computer Science Article:</a
        >
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Teachers gave the tool an average usability score of 4.36/5.0.</li>
        <li>They found it easy to use and navigate.</li>
        <li>
          The teachers found that the tool could complement their lessons.
        </li>
        <li>
          The teachers enjoyed having sample data they could instantly pull up,
          rather than having to search something themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          The teachers found they could implement the tool into student
          assignments and increase their students' data analysis skills.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Overall, the findings that Sean (the student who continued my work on
        the tool) was able to make confirmed the findings I had made early on. I
        think there is still room for additional feedback and more ways to
        receive feedback in a different setting that may be less prone to bias,
        but overall the results are reliable.
      </p>

      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project gave me a passion for UX/UI work, research, and working
        together with users to solve problems. It helped me realize the empathy
        I have for the user's experience. I learned many lessons throughout this
        time, but five stuck out the most.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Compensation is Crucial</b>— Survey responses towards the end were
        low. When we weren't able to leverage our workshop to get survey
        responses, the surveys fell flat. At the time of the project, we were
        working through a pandemic. As shown through research, teachers were
        already strained on time. During a pandemic, this was even clearer.
        Asking teachers to essentially do volunteer work was a lot to ask. If I
        could do this again, I would have opted to leverage a portion of our
        budget towards compensating any of our target users who wanted to give
        us some feedback. After all, even beloved companies like Google pay
        their users for responses. This would have given us the feedback we
        needed to fix any problems in the site earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Design Early and Receive Feedback Often</b>— When I began the
        project, I had 3 weeks to work on the web-tool until I was expected to
        demo it during a workshop to our target users. For those 3 weeks I
        passionately worked on the project and build out a functional version of
        the site, which I thought would be more exciting for teachers to engage
        with. While I admire my drive, I think I should have spent more time on
        mockups and receiving feedback earlier rather than later. I didn't rely
        on design (utilizing programs like Figma) heavily enough, and often
        found myself tweaking CSS code and refreshing the page a dozen times to
        get something right. If I had spent time designing each page in Figma
        first, I could have received feedback on those designs (which are easier
        to tweak) and saved myself time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Teamwork is Everything </b>— It's easy to get absorbed in your own
        world when you're the only one working on a project. Having other
        perspectives can help you rethink things you may have overlooked. Having
        a well-rounded team with different backgrounds can only result in a more
        well-rounded product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Testing is Also... Everything </b>— Things go wrong. It's a natural
        part of the process. I learned how regularly problems, even the same
        problems, can appear and reappear with every change. I walked away from
        this project having a better appreciation but for the design phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Passion, Passion, Passion</b>— Without it, I don't think I would have
        accomplished half of what I did on this project. Learning new
        technologies and focusing on a problem that I felt was important helped
        constantly motivate me. I went from knowing very little HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, to feeling comfortable implementing any feature.
      </p>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>
        I wrote about the future of the project in my

          >Frontiers in Computer Science Article.</a

        To recap here, I envisioned the site having a larger selection of
        engaging data that teachers could directly use, as well more ways to
        streamline the data cleaning process. In addition to that, I wanted the
        site to have more resources for teachers to create effective charts and
        guide them along the way towards best practices. I wrote a proposal to
        extend the work on this tool, and that proposal was accepted. After
        another student's work, the datasets available on the site have
        increased massively.
