            In October 2021, I was the main author (responsible for all sections

            I have a
            <a href="https://medium.com/@matthew_michael">Medium page.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            My highest viewed piece was published by DevGenius, a publication
            with over 10k followers. It was also curated by Medium, meaning the
            editors at the site found the piece of considerable quality and
            promoted it throughout their site and newsletter.

            I use this space to freely express myself. I also use it to
            challenge myself through extensive research, as shown by my

        <p>Some things I <b>really</b> like about writing:</p>
        <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
          <li>Fitting the tone of a product</li>
          <li>Making my writing 'fun' to read through whitespace and style</li>
          <li>Editing</li>
          <li>Researching until my browser can't handle the tabs</li>
          <li>*Changing my ideas in light of better evidence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          * On my article about social media and mental health, I thought many
          social media companies neglected the topic entirely, but I discovered
          that companies like Facebook actually have extensive measures for
          caring about their users.
        </p>

        <h3>Case Studies</h3>
        <p>
          Let me take you through a journey. We'll start with a critique of my
          first project before I studied ux and technical writing and discovered
          the importance of making every word matter.
        </p>
        <h2 id="simplechartsri">SimpleChartsRI (3 before/after comparisons)</h2>

        <p>
          I wrote the site's copy. While it didn't have any major problems, I
          would have changed some things looking back.
        </p>
        <p>
          One trick I learned since finishing this project was to write down 3
          adjectives for your brand in order to identify your brand's voice.
          Here it would have been <b>simple, informative, and friendly.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's start with the landing page, which had some slight room for
          improvement.
        </p>
        <h4 id="scriLandingpage">Landing Page - Before</h4>
        <img
          style="margin-top: 1rem !important"
          src="resources/scri-landing.png"
        />
        <p>
          The <i>Create a Chart</i> button could have been changed to just
          <i>Create</i>, but for our target audience (teachers who are not
          tech-savvy) I thought the redudnacy may have been helpful (a/b test
          could have been useful), though there was another problem at play with
          this choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking the <i>Create a Chart</i> button brings you to the
          <i>Choose Data</i> step, not a page with an actual chart on it. Not
          the worst problem, just not super clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I would have removed the body text for each step and just
          kept the header. The user doesn't need to be overwhelmed here, they
          can progressively understand the finer details as they go along. In
          addition to making the colors pop a little more, I would have changed
          the border to be rounder to fit with that friendly theme.
        </p>
        <h4>Landing Page - After</h4>
        <img
          style="margin-top: 1rem !important"
          src="resources/scri - landing (after).png"
        />
        <p>
          <b
            >Now it's simple, informative without boring you, and has a friendly
            feel.</b
          >
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Other Copy Changes</h4>
        <p>
          While I could probably rewrite most of the site to add onto those 3
          new adjectives, I will spare you and choose only a few examples that
          demonstrate what I've learned since then.
        </p>
        <p>I will rebuild each section using Figma for simplicity.</p>
        <h4 id="scriHelp1">Help Documentation - Zooming & Panning section</h4>
        <img
          style="margin-top: 1rem !important; max-height: 900px"
          src="resources/scri-helpdoc.png"
        />
        <p>These changes are better for a few reasons.</p>
        <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
          <li>Removed obvious info</li>
          <li>Visually separated information where it made sense</li>
          <li>Front-heavy text increases skimmability</li>
          <li>Concrete writing (300 pieces of data)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This section doesn't need to be thorough like some technical
          documentation for a specific method call. If our tool's main
          functionality saves the user's time, so should its documentation so
          long as it maintains its precision.
        </p>

        <h4 id="scriHelp2">Help Documentation - Formatting section</h4>
        <img
          style="margin-top: 1rem !important; max-height: 2631px"
          src="resources/scri-helpdoc 2.png"
        />

        <h2 id="otherstudies">Micro Case Studies</h2>
        <p>
          Even the biggest companies have bad UX. Here are some adjustments I'd
          make to what I've found.
        </p>
        <h4 id="facebook">Facebook</h4>
        <p>
          I tried making a business account for my newsletter. But when making
          the name, Facebook gave me this error message.
        </p>
        <img
          style="margin-top: 1rem !important; max-width: 692px"
          src="resources/facebookerror.png"
        />
        <p>
          Ok, Dad. Can an error message sound any more formal? The project was
          not called ZuckSucks, but the message was the same. Even the error
          icon in the input box didn't specify the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was I supposed to do with this information? Was the username
          taken? Was the name not allowed? Did I not authenticate my account
          first? Why do I need to read a guide? Why can't it just tell me?
        </p>
        <p>It turned out my name was taken.</p>
        <p>A simple <b>"Username taken."</b> would have done just fine.</p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Blog post on UX Writing (Mailchimp)</h4>

        <img
          style="margin-top: 1rem !important; max-width: 513px"

          in a blog post.

          "Not only does the customer get feedback about the task (mail will go
          out shortly) but it also eases the anxiety of the user by offering a
          friendly high five."
        </p>
        <p>While I agree it is mostly great, I think it can be improved.</p>
        <p>
          What is a send queue? Users at this point shouldn't have more
          questions. This is not the place for jargon, even if most people can
          understand what it is.
        </p>
        <p>We can make it more concrete by removing the jargon.</p>
        <p><b>Your campaign will go out shortly.</b></p>
        <p>Ah, that's better.</p>
