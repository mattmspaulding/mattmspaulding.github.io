      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        I always thought my passion was for programming. While it is a core
        passion, I realized (after reflecting on my thought process throughout
        every project I've worked on) that my true passion is the user, and on
        their experience. In my experience, most Computer Science students are
        brought to believe that they will become Software Engineers. While it
        may be great for some, I don't think it reflects the diversity found
        within every person. Some people love problem-solving through code,
        others may love design. TheNerdyKing plans to give an overview of many
        different areas so students (or anyone!) can find what field matches
        their skillset and have the necessary resources to help drive them
        further in that field.
      </p>

      <h3>Objective</h3>

      <p>
        My plan for the site currently is to launch a beta version. This version
        will include information and resources for around 10 different topics. I
        will receive usability feedback through different sites like sprig.com
        and usertesting.com. This will help me understand anything I may have
        overlooked, as well as what further information can best help students.
      </p>

      <p>
        After launch I plan on sending monthly newsletters on resources and
        deals for students. Ultimately this tool will serve as a collection of
        resources that have either served myself or others.
