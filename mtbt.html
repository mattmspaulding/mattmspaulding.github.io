      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Every morning, millions of people receive newsletters on current events
        in the world of business and technology. But a whole world is missing.
        Most newsletters on creativity/art are made by personal brands who tie
        their own makings into each newsletter. There isn't something more
        general to the creative world at large. Creative Cosmos is like the
        Morning Brew for artists.
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>
        The development process has been underway for about a month. Here's what
        I've done in that time.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-display list-checkmarks">
        <li>Extensively researched other newsletters.</li>
        <li>Created a landing page in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Found an email provider - ConvertKit.</li>
        <li>Created a backlog of content.</li>
        <li>Sorted that content into organized sections.</li>
        <li>Drafted a newsletter template with custom HTML & CSS.</li>
        <li>Identified the brand's tone.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Readers should be able skim through the newsletter and get something out
        of it. This means a lot of whitespace and short sentences. Because of
        this, every sentence must pack a punch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> shined here. It was fun to read
        simply because of how fast you felt like you were making progress.
        Sprinkle onto that some emojis, bolded headlines, nice colors, and
        bizarre sayings that are actually somewhat meaningful at second glance
        and you have a newsletter you can withstand reading.
      </p>

      <p>
        The newsletter is built on a quote. Here's a secret page on the site
        where I explain that:
      </p>
      <img
        src="resources/mtbt-shh.png"
        style="max-width: 568px !important; max-height: 1052px !important"
      />

      <p>
        Overall the newsletter is designed to be like a buddy who updates and
        inspires you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think there's too much of a gap between people who think about making
        stuff and people who actually share their art with the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this newsletter, I want to help minimize that gap (even if only by
        a teeny-tiny bit).
